            JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a
            high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the
            ECMAScript specification. It is a programming language that is
            characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and
            multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core
            technologies of the World Wide Web.[9] JavaScript enables interactive
            web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast
            majority of websites use it,[10] and major web browsers have a dedicated
            JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language,
            JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including
            object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for
            working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but
            the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking,
            storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in
            which it is embedded to provide these features.
