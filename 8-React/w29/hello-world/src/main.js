            <h3>Node JS</h3>
            <article>
                Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time
                environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
                JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in which
                scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run
                client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. Node.js
                lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for
                server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic
                web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
                Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere"
                paradigm,[7] unifying web application development around a single
                programming language, rather than different languages for server side
                and client side scripts. Though .js is the standard filename extension
                for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" does not refer to a particular
                file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js
                has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These
                design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web
                applications with many input/output operations, as well as for
                real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and
                browser games).[8] The Node.js distributed development project,
                governed by the Node.js Foundation,[9] is facilitated by the Linux
                Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[10] Corporate users of
                Node.js software include GoDaddy,[11] Groupon,[12] IBM,[13]
                LinkedIn,[14][15] Microsoft,[16][17] Netflix,[18] PayPal,[19][20]

                HTML 5 is the fifth and current major version of the HTML standard,
                and subsumes XHTML. It currently exists in two standardized forms:
                HTML 5.2 Recommendation[4] by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, a
                broad coalition of organizations), intended primarily for Web content
                developers; and HTML Living Standard[5] by WHATWG (a small consortium
                of four browser vendors), intended primarily for browser developers,
                though it also exists in an abridged Web developer version.[6] There
                are minor conflicts between the two groups' specifications.
            </p>

                HTML 5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[7]
                with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October
                2014.[2][8] Its goals are to improve the language with support for the
                latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both
                easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and
                devices such as Web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity;
                and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML 5 is
                intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2
                HTML;[9] the HTML 4 and XHTML specs were announced as superseded by
                HTML 5.2 on 27 March 2018.[10] HTML 5 includes detailed processing
                models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends,
                improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and
                introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for
                complex web applications.[11] For the same reasons, HTML 5 is also a
                candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes
                features designed with low-powered devices in mind.
